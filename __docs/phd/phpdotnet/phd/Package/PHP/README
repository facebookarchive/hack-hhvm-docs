Rendering the documentations for the first time:
	WINDOWS:
		#1) cd c:\
		#2) svn checkout http://svn.php.net/repository/phpdoc/modules/doc-en
		#3) cd doc-en\doc-base
		#4) php configure.php
    #5) phd --docbook c:\doc-en\doc-base\.manual.xml

	*NIX:
		#1) cd ~
		#2) svn checkout http://svn.php.net/repository/phpdoc/modules/doc-en
		#3) cd doc-en/doc-base
		#4) php configure.php
    #5) phd --docbook ~/doc-en/doc-base/.manual.xml


This will create
	"php" directory containing the "phpweb" files
		NOTE: You CANNOT view these files without a phpweb mirror running.
			  See https://doc.php.net/wiki/phd/view#viewing_the_phpfolder
	"html" directory containing the "downloadable chunked html" files
		NOTE: Do NOT move these files onto your webserver. Just double click
			  them and your browser will open and show you the content
	"bightml.html" file, which is the "downloadable bightml" file

Now edit the XML files as you wish in the doc-en/en directory.
To build the documentation again follow the instructions above, skipping step#2.

NOTE: To work on translations, you should replace the 'en' in all
of the above examples with the appropriate ISO 639-1 Code of the desired language.
(see http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/codes.asp for a list of codes)
e.g. 'pt' for Portuguese, or pt_BR for Brazillian Portuguese. Step two in the
example above would change to:
	svn checkout http://svn.php.net/repository/phpdoc/modules/doc-pt
or
	svn checkout http://svn.php.net/repository/phpdoc/modules/doc-pt_BR
The XML files to edit will be in doc-pt/pt or doc-pt_BR/pt_BR directories.
